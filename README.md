# Nathan Contentful Blog Test 

This repo was forked from the Gatsby Starter Blog for learning Contentful: https://github.com/contentful/starter-gatsby-blog

I thought the format was pretty simple and fun so I would try setting it up for
my own blog!

## Crucial Commands

### `npm run dev`

Run the project locally with live reload in development mode.

### `npm run build`

Run a production build into `./public`. The result is ready to be put on any static hosting you prefer.

### `npm run serve`

Spin up a production-ready server with your blog. Don't forget to build your page beforehand.

## Deployment

See the [official Contentful getting started guide](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/tutorials/general/get-started/).
